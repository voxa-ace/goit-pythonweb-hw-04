### Example Usage

To run the script, use the following command in the terminal, replacing the paths with your desired source and output folder paths:

```
python file_sorter.py /path/to/source_folder /path/to/output_folder
```

This code will organize files into subfolders within the destination folder based on file extensions, handling a large number of files more efficiently by performing the copying operations asynchronously.
